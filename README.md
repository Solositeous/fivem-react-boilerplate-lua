This is the Project Error one but removes some silly things

```
yarn install -- to install all the modules

yarn start -- for dev mode

yarn build -- for production mode
```

I recommend using components for anything that is going to be reused

If you are making something with pages I recommend creating a pages folder and putting all the pages in there and makeing a page handler in providers. I will add an example when I make something that requires pages

If you are not one of my devs you will need to remove the sd_util code from the lua files and make your own debug methods
